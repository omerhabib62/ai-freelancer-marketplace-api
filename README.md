# AI-Powered Freelancer Marketplace API with Learning Module

## Overview

The **AI-Powered Freelancer Marketplace API** is a robust backend application built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), designed to facilitate a freelance platform where clients post projects, freelancers bid, and freelancers enhance their skills through a learning module. The platform integrates **AI-driven recommendations** for projects and courses, real-time chat, and analytics, making it a unique and scalable solution for modern freelance marketplaces.

This project demonstrates mastery of all [NestJS documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/) topics, including controllers, modules, authentication, database integration, GraphQL, WebSockets, microservices, and more. Itâ€™s built with scalability and real-world applicability in mind, using a modern tech stack and best practices.
